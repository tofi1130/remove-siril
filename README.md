# remove-siril
Remove Siril on Linux, installed from commands meson ninja install

# Selecting Interpreter
Don't forget to change the shebang at the top of the shell script!

# How to use
1. ```chmod +x remove-siril.sh```
2. ```sudo ./remove-siril.sh```

# Note
This removes the files as mentioned by the ninja install command, as it
states the files when installing like
Installing <this> to <that>
I don't know any thing after that. lol
